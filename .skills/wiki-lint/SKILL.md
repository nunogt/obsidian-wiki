# Wiki Lint — Health Audit

You are performing a health check on an Obsidian wiki. Your goal is to find and fix structural issues that degrade the wiki's value over time.

## Before You Start

1. Read `.env` to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
2. Read `index.md` for the full page inventory
3. Read `log.md` for recent activity context

## Lint Checks

Run these checks in order. Report findings as you go.

### 1. Orphaned Pages

Find pages with zero incoming wikilinks. These are knowledge islands that nothing connects to.

**How to check:**
- Glob all `.md` files in the vault
- For each page, Grep the rest of the vault for `[[page-name]]` references
- Pages with zero incoming links (except `index.md` and `log.md`) are orphans

**How to fix:**
- Identify which existing pages should link to the orphan
- Add wikilinks in appropriate sections

### 2. Broken Wikilinks

Find `[[wikilinks]]` that point to pages that don't exist.

**How to check:**
- Grep for `\[\[.*?\]\]` across all pages
- Extract the link targets
- Check if a corresponding `.md` file exists

**How to fix:**
- If the target was renamed, update the link
- If the target should exist, create it
- If the link is wrong, remove or correct it

### 3. Missing Frontmatter

Every page should have: title, category, tags, sources, created, updated.

**How to check:**
- Read each page and parse frontmatter
- Flag pages missing required fields

**How to fix:**
- Add missing fields with reasonable defaults

### 4. Stale Content

Pages whose `updated` timestamp is old relative to their sources.

**How to check:**
- Compare page `updated` timestamps to source file modification times
- Flag pages where sources have been modified after the page was last updated

### 5. Contradictions

Claims that conflict across pages.

**How to check:**
- This requires reading related pages and comparing claims
- Focus on pages that share tags or are heavily cross-referenced
- Look for phrases like "however", "in contrast", "despite" that may signal existing acknowledged contradictions vs. unacknowledged ones

**How to fix:**
- Add an "Open Questions" section noting the contradiction
- Reference both sources and their claims

### 6. Index Consistency

Verify `index.md` matches the actual page inventory.

**How to check:**
- Compare pages listed in `index.md` to actual files on disk
- Check that summaries in `index.md` still match page content

### 7. Provenance Drift

Check whether pages are being honest about how much of their content is inferred vs extracted. See the Provenance Markers section in `llm-wiki` for the convention.

**How to check:**
- For each page, count sentences/bullets in the body and how many end with `^[inferred]` or `^[ambiguous]`
- Compute the rough fractions (`extracted`, `inferred`, `ambiguous`)
- **Speculation-heavy:** flag pages where `inferred + ambiguous > 0.6` of total content. The wiki is supposed to compile knowledge, not speculate.
- **Drift:** if the page has a `provenance:` frontmatter block, flag it when any field is more than 0.20 off from the recomputed value.
- **Skip** pages that have no `provenance:` frontmatter and no markers — they're treated as fully extracted by convention (the check is opt-in for older pages).

**How to fix:**
- For drift: update the `provenance:` frontmatter to match reality.
- For speculation-heavy: re-ingest the page from its sources, or split the inferred content into a `synthesis/` page (where speculation is expected) and leave the original page tighter.

## Output Format

Report findings as a structured list:

```markdown
## Wiki Health Report

### Orphaned Pages (N found)
- `concepts/foo.md` — no incoming links

### Broken Wikilinks (N found)
- `entities/bar.md:15` — links to [[nonexistent-page]]

### Missing Frontmatter (N found)
- `skills/baz.md` — missing: tags, sources

### Stale Content (N found)
- `references/paper-x.md` — source modified 2024-03-10, page last updated 2024-01-05

### Contradictions (N found)
- `concepts/scaling.md` claims "X" but `synthesis/efficiency.md` claims "not X"

### Index Issues (N found)
- `concepts/new-page.md` exists on disk but not in index.md

### Provenance Issues (N found)
- `concepts/scaling.md` — speculation-heavy: 72% of bullets marked `^[inferred]`
- `entities/some-tool.md` — drift: frontmatter says inferred=0.10, recomputed=0.45
```

## After Linting

Append to `log.md`:
```
- [TIMESTAMP] LINT issues_found=N orphans=X broken_links=Y stale=Z contradictions=W prov_issues=P
```

Offer to fix issues automatically or let the user decide which to address.
